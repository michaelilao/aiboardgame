## About The Project

<i>This project was developer for McMaster Software Engineering Final Year Capstone.</i>

Designing a board game is a tedious process, one aspect that can be improved is in the testing phase. Instead of paying humans to manually test a game, we've created a system that uses AI to simulate thousands of games to expedite this process.

### Built With

The AI system is built with Python and uses <a href="https://tianshou.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Tianshou</a></li>, <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/">Gymnasium</a></li> and <a href="https://pettingzoo.farama.org/">PettingZoo</a></li> for multi-agent reinforcement learning. The Data visualizer is built with React and <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html">Apache ECharts</a></li>
